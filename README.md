# Things to do
> This repo is a list of random things to do.
> 
> They are mostly things that are deemed inconsequential and therefore not paid attention to, especially during the early phases of a project, but they are just as important as any other aspect of the project.

## Buttons
* When creating buttons that performs `Create` actions, e.g a button that submits a form, disable the button after the first click. This will prevent the user from clicking the button multiple times therefore causing the action to be repeated multiple times.
  
## Lists
* Put pagination in mind when retrieving and displaying a list of records. This is quite often overlooked in the early stages of the project because you'd only have a few records to deal with, but as time passes, it starts to get bulky and the impact becomes bigger.
